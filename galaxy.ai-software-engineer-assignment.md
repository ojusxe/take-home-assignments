# Project Overview

Build **NextFlow** — a pixel-perfect clone of the Galaxy.ai workflow builder, focused exclusively on LLM workflows. Use **React Flow** for the canvas, **Google Gemini** for LLM execution, and **Trigger.dev** for all node execution.

**Scope of pages — only these three. Nothing else.**

1. **Clerk Sign-In / Sign-Up** — auth entry point
2. **Dashboard** — post-login landing page listing all of the signed-in user's workflows (name, last-edited timestamp, status). Supports create-new, open, rename, and delete.
3. **Workflow Canvas** — the main builder page (sidebar + canvas + history panel).

Do not build a marketing page, landing page, pricing page, or any other public-facing surface.
Unauthenticated traffic should be redirected straight to Clerk.

## Your Reference (We’ve Got You Covered)

So you're not guessing at any UI/UX detail:

1. Sign up for a free account at **galaxy.ai**.
2. Visit **try.galaxy.ai/clone** and click **Clone Workflow**.
3. You'll get full access to the canvas, sidebar, node UI, history panel, and animations. You won't have credits to run it, but you can inspect every interaction and visual detail.

Running workflow ref:

[https://drive.google.com/file/d/14D2052n6b3lIMRHYxavDbOaRPOvj6FR8/view?usp=drive_link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14D2052n6b3lIMRHYxavDbOaRPOvj6FR8/view?usp=drive_link)

This is the source of truth for the UI/UX. Match it pixel-perfect — do not deviate. Anything not explicitly listed in this document should mirror the Galaxy.ai reference exactly (spacing, fonts, colors, hover states, animations, scroll behavior, edge styling, MiniMap, dot grid, etc.).

## Timeline

**3 days.** Scope your work to ship a polished, working demo of the core flow — don't over-extend.

# A Note to Applicants

We're transforming the way people work with AI. Millions of creators and teams at the world's most ambitious companies already build with us — but we have much more work to do.

We obsess over talent to an unusual degree and are building a company that's a haven for self-motivated individual contributors.

We understand this is a significant time investment and it is deliberate by design. We're looking for people who enjoy building things like this, not people who see it as a chore.

And no, this is not a sneaky attempt to get free engineering work. We're perfectly capable of building our own tools. This is purely to see how you think, build, and ship.

**So bring your A-game.** This could be the beginning of a highly rewarding journey. We can't wait to see what you build.

# Functional Requirements

## Adding nodes — match Galaxy.ai exactly

Galaxy.ai does **not** have a left sidebar of node buttons. Instead:

* A new workflow canvas opens with two nodes already placed: **Request-Inputs** (top/left) and **Response** (right). The user cannot delete these.
* All other nodes are added via the **+** button in the bottom-center floating toolbar, which opens a searchable picker with categories (**Recent, Image, Video, Audio, Others**). For this trial only **Crop Image** and **Gemini 3.1 Pro** need to be functional — match the picker UI/UX of the live reference.

## The 4 node types

1. **Request-Inputs** *(pre-placed on canvas)* — single node with a **+** to add configurable fields. Supported field types: `text_field` (textarea) and `image_field` (Transloadit upload, jpg/jpeg/png/webp/gif, with preview). Each field exposes its own output handle so it can be wired into downstream nodes. The user can rename fields and add as many as needed (e.g., `text_field`, `image_field`, `image_field_2`).

2. **Crop Image** *(added via + picker)* — inputs: **Input Image** (required) + **X Position (%)**, **Y Position (%)**, **Width (%)**, **Height (%)** (0-100, defaults 0/0/100/100). FFmpeg via Trigger.dev. Output: **Output Image** (cropped image URL).

3. **Gemini 3.1 Pro** *(added via + picker — LLM)* — model selector in node header. Inputs: **Prompt** (required), **System Prompt**, **Image (Vision)**, **Video**, **Audio**, **File**, plus a collapsed **Settings** section. Output: **Response** (text), rendered inline on the node.

4. **Response** *(pre-placed on canvas)* — single result input handle. Collects the final workflow output for display/export. No output handle.

## MANDATORY: 30+ second artificial delay on Crop Image

The Crop Image Trigger.dev task must await at least 30 seconds before returning.
This is a hard requirement — do not skip it.

## Authentication

* Clerk for everything. All workflow routes protected. Workflows + history scoped to the authenticated user.

## Dashboard Page

* Lists all workflows belonging to the signed-in user (name, last-edited timestamp, status badge if a run is in progress).
* **Create New Workflow** button → opens a blank canvas.
* Per-row actions: **Open, Rename, Delete**.
* Empty state when the user has no workflows yet.
* Match Galaxy.ai's dashboard styling (same sidebar, same card/list pattern).

## LLM Integration

* Provider: Google Gemini (`@google/generative-ai`). Free tier via Google AI Studio.
* Execution: All LLM calls run as Trigger.dev tasks. No exceptions.
* Vision: multimodal images supported (the **Image (Vision)** handle accepts multiple connections).
* Models: see Gemini models. Default to Gemini 3.1 Pro to match the reference.
* Result display: rendered inline on the Gemini node's **Response** section. The standalone **Response** node is a separate node type used to collect a final workflow result, not a substitute for inline LLM output.

# Workflow Features

* Add nodes via the bottom **+** picker (Crop Image, Gemini 3.1 Pro). Request-Inputs and Response are pre-placed and not deletable.
* Animated edges between handles.
* Configurable inputs: every parameter accepts either a connection OR manual entry. When a handle is connected, the manual field is greyed out / disabled.
* Type-safe connections: image outputs cannot connect to text inputs, etc. Invalid drags are visually rejected.
* DAG-only: cycles disallowed.
* Delete: menu button + Delete/Backspace keyboard (Request-Inputs and Response are exempt — they cannot be deleted).
* Canvas: pan, zoom, fit-view, MiniMap (bottom-right), dot grid background.
* Undo/Redo for node operations.
* Selective execution: run a single node, run a multi-select, or run the whole workflow. Each creates a history entry.
* Parallel execution: independent nodes trigger concurrently. A finished node fans out to its dependents immediately — it must never block on unrelated siblings at the same DAG level.
* Pulsating glow on every node currently executing.
* Persistence: workflows + history saved to PostgreSQL.
* Export/Import workflows as JSON.

# Workflow History (Right Sidebar)

* List of all runs with timestamp, status (success / failed / partial), duration, scope (full / partial / single).
* Color-coded badges (green / red / yellow).
* Click a run → expand to node-level details: per-node status, inputs used, output, execution time, error if failed.
* Persisted to PostgreSQL.

Example expanded view:

Run #123 — Apr 25, 2026 3:45 PM (Full Workflow)

* Request-Inputs ✅ 0.1s → `text_field`, `image_field`

* Crop Image #1 ✅ 31.8s → `https://cdn.transloadit.com/...`

* Crop Image #2 ✅ 32.1s → `https://cdn.transloadit.com/...`

* Gemini #1 ✅ 4.2s → `"Introducing our premium..."`

* Gemini #2 ✅ 3.9s → `"Silence the world. 30 hrs..."`

* Final Gemini ✅ 4.5s → `"Hear what matters..."`

* Response ✅ 0.1s → final result captured

# Tech Stack (Required)

Next.js (App Router) · TypeScript (strict) · PostgreSQL (Neon) · Prisma · Clerk · React Flow · Trigger.dev · Transloadit · FFmpeg (via Trigger.dev) · Tailwind · Zustand · Zod · `@google/generative-ai` · Lucide React.

**Trigger.dev rule:** Every executable node (Gemini, Crop Image) runs as a Trigger.dev task. Request-Inputs and Response are local-only (no Trigger.dev task — they just resolve values and capture the final result). Independent tasks fire concurrently; each task only awaits its direct upstream dependencies. On the initial client render of every page, also emit exactly one `console.log` in the format:

`[NextFlow] Candidate LinkedIn: <full-linkedin-profile-url>`

so we can attribute the build.

## Nodes

| # | Type                      | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| - | ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 | Request-Inputs            | Two fields: `text_field = "Product: Wireless Bluetooth Headphones. Features: Noise cancellation, 30-hour battery, foldable design."` and `image_field = uploaded product photo`                    |
| 2 | Crop Image #1             | x=20, y=20, w=60, h=60 (tight product crop)                                                                                                                                                        |
| 3 | Crop Image #2             | x=0, y=0, w=100, h=50 (wide banner crop)                                                                                                                                                           |
| 4 | Gemini 3.1 Pro #1         | System Prompt: `"You are a marketing copywriter. Write a one-paragraph product description."` — Prompt ← Request-Inputs.text_field                                                                 |
| 5 | Gemini 3.1 Pro #2         | System Prompt: `"Condense the following product description into a tweet-length hook (under 240 characters)."` — Prompt ← Gemini #1.Response                                                       |
| 6 | Gemini 3.1 Pro #3 (Final) | System Prompt: `"You are a social media manager. Combine the tweet hook and the two product crops into a final marketing post."` — Prompt ← Gemini #2.Response, Image (Vision) ← Crop #1 + Crop #2 |
| 7 | Response                  | `result ← Final Gemini.Response`                                                                                                                                                                   |

## Edges

* Request-Inputs.image_field → Crop #1.Input Image, Crop #2.Input Image
  *(single source fans out)*
* Request-Inputs.text_field → Gemini #1.Prompt
* Gemini #1.Response → Gemini #2.Prompt
* Crop #1.Output Image, Crop #2.Output Image → Final Gemini.Image (Vision)
* Gemini #2.Response → Final Gemini.Prompt
* Final Gemini.Response → Response.result

## Expected execution behavior

When the workflow runs:

1. Crop #1, Crop #2, and Gemini #1 all start at T=0 (same DAG level → concurrent fan-out).
2. Gemini #2 starts as soon as Gemini #1 finishes — it must not wait for the Crop nodes.
3. Final Gemini only starts once all of its upstream dependencies (both Crops + Gemini #2) have completed.
4. Single-node and multi-select runs execute only the targeted nodes.

# Deliverables
